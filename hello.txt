Iâ€™m one of the co-founders of Halvex, a startup that aims to 
provide revolutionary digital 
solutions to make a positive impact on the world.

I'm also working on a side project called Syndia with a 
few others at Halvex, a simple idea that integrates AI Vision 
with existing camera systems in retail stores and public 
premises to detect shoplifting, and various threats like 
firearms and weapons.

In my free time I like to drive the speed limit while blasting
music (house, rap, R&B, rock) down the highway, play 
pickleball with my friends, and maybe, just once in a while,
edit what you're looking at right now.
